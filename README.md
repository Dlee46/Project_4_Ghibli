## Application
[Ghibli Review](https://ghibli-review.herokuapp.com/)

## Overview
To test the language of Ruby, I created a movie review application that was focused on Studio Ghibli films. The application uses the knowledge that I've gained for the past 12 weeks to produce a full CRUD app with 3 models. The models are users, reviews, and movies. The application uses the follow libraries and language:

- RUBY
  - RAILS
  - DEVISE
- JAVASCRIPT
  - REACTJS
    - REACT SEMANTIC UI
    - STYLED COMPONENTS
- HTML 5
- CSS
- API
  - [Studio Ghibli](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/)
- Postgresql
- HEROKU
- POSTMAN
- GITHUB

It was honestly one of the hardest project. This was because I had a hard time generating ideas. In the future, I would like to create more options for user experience. The app only meets MVP and requires more styling from being constrained from time.
